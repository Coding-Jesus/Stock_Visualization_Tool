# Stock_Visualization_Tool
This script allows a user to input a stock ticker and start and end dates, and generates a visual analysis of the stock's performance during that time period. The analysis includes simple moving averages, Bollinger Bands, and a 10.4.4 stochastic oscillator, as well as green and blue dots for potential buy and sell signals. The script also includes a loop that allows the user to input multiple tickers in a row until they enter 'quit'.
## Dependencies

- operator
- tracemalloc
